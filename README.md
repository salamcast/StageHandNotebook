# StageHandNotebook
 
 The StageHandNotebook project is a collection of Python Modules and Notebooks for preforming calculations and documentation for people working on the Technical side of the Entertainment and Motion Picture industry, Particularly people that work with the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE).  
 
 Calculators provided are for Event Power Distribution, Lighting and Rigging.
 
Take a look at the provided notebooks to get an example of how to use these modules.

I plan to eventually add Jupyter Widgets to make the calculators more user friendly for the non programmers.
